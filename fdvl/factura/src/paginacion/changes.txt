* Added some messages for pagination

28 May 2009
* Fixed caching so that it is now effective.
* Added the Search tool. It is like the Filter tool but searches the whole record instead of just column.
* Added a messages (msgs) global variable for keeping all text delivered to the user in one place. In the future it might be useful for i18n type stuff.
* Added a message to the user when there are no results displayed on an updateTable call.
* Added documentation to the unpacked version of the TableOrderer.js

23 May 2009
* Added First and Last pagination buttons
* Integrated a caching feature so that paging and ordering operations are only using cached data. The cached is updated when filtered. This will hopefully allow larger datasets to be used.

21 May 2009
* Added a new option called pageCount for number of items by table
* Changed paginate to define where the pagination should show up (similar to filter option)
* Added a new tools object to keep the state of the filter and pagination tools instead of querying the DOM as much.
* Broke addObserver into addToolsObserver and addTableObserver since the tools (filter and pagination) have its HTML elements created once where the table elements are created over and over.
* filterData now has two approaches: (1) If pagination is turned ON then recreate the rows using updateTable. Somewhat costly due to creating new elements but hopefully offset by a smaller amount of rows being shown. (2) If pagination is turned OFF then just hiding the rows, which is much faster.
* createTable and createRows are only used the first time the table is created. It sets everything up. updateTable and updateRows just update the data information on the screen.
* Pagination and filtering are now independent of each other. Which means you can have pagination turned on while filtering turned off and vice-versa. And pagination can be on top while filtering on the bottom or vice-versa.
